        "What is a valve",
        "Control valves are imperative elements in any system where fluid flow must be monitored and manipulated.",
        "The basic valve is used to permit or restrain the flow of fluid and/or adjust the pressure in a system. A complete control valve is made of the valve itself, an actuator, and, if necessary, a valve control device. The actuator is what provides the required force to cause the closing part of the valve to move. Valve control devices keep the valves in the proper operating conditions; they can ensure appropriate position, interpret signals, and manipulate responses.",
        "TYPES OF VALVES",
        "We have different types of valves to suit different services and conditions i.e. different uses (e.g. on/off), different fluids for example liquids, gases, etc, different materials and different pressure and temperature conditions",
        "1.	Ball valves.",
        "A ball valve is a valve with a spherical disc, the part of the valve which controls the flow through it. The sphere has a hole, or port, through the middle so that when the port is in line with both ends of the valve, flow will occur. When the valve is closed, the hole is perpendicular to the ends of the valve, and flow is blocked. There are four types of ball valves.:"

    "The history of computers in education can be traced back to the 1960s when computers were first introduced as tools for processing and analysing data. Initially, computers were primarily used for administrative tasks within educational institutions, such as managing student records and grading systems.",
    "However, as technology advanced and computer technology became more accessible, computers began to be integrated into the classroom as a tool for instruction. In the 1970s and 1980s, schools started to introduce computer labs where students could learn basic programming and computer skills.",
    "The widespread adoption of personal computers in the 1990s further accelerated the integration of technology into education. Teachers began incorporating computer-based programs and educational software into their lesson plans, allowing students to learn at their own pace and explore topics in new and interactive ways.",

    "In recent years, the rise of the internet and mobile technology has further transformed the educational landscape, offering students access to a wealth of information and resources at their fingertips. Online learning platforms, educational apps, and virtual reality tools have become increasingly popular in classrooms, providing new and innovative ways for students to engage with educational content.",
